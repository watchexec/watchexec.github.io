	<p>
		Both <strong>Watchexec</strong> and <strong>Cargo Watch</strong> have official binary
		builds available here and over at their respective GitHub Release pages. The latest release
		for both is shown below, and historical builds are also available. Since mid-2021, checksums
		and signatures are available.

	<details>
		<summary>More details on checksums and signatures</summary>

		<p>
			Checksums are provided as <a href="https://blake3.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLAKE3</a>
			and as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SHA512</a>.
			SHA512 sums may be deprecated in the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			Signatures use the <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Minisign</a>
			format. There are many compatible implementations of Minisign; some are listed at the above
			link. At the moment, signatures are generated using the
			<a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/rsign2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rsign2</a> tool.
		</p>

		<p>
			Releases are signed multiple times (at least once), with different keys, which provide
			different trust levels. Each project has its own <em>"automated release key"</em>, which it
			uses to sign releases when they are built, in the build infrastructure. Then, maintainers
			<em>manually</em> sign the release. The automated signature provides weak trust,
			authenticating only that a build is official. Maintainer signature(s) provide stronger trust,
			in that the release is verified by a person.
		</p>

		<p>
			Releases built by other packagers, from source, or via
			<code class="inline shell"><span class="command">cargo</span> <span class="subcommand">install</span></code>,
			are not signed as part of this scheme, though they may be signed by the packager separately.
			Packagers building on these official binary releases <em>should strongly consider</em>
			verifying signatures as part of their process. Watchexec and associated projects only
			officiate the builds on this page and on the projects GitHub Releases pages, and do not
			endorse any other packaging effort. Caveat emptor.
