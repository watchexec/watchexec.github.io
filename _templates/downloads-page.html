		Official binaries for our projects are available here. On the GitHub page for each project, there
		are also alternative installation methods, via third-party packages; <em>these are unofficial and
		not verified by this project</em>.
	</p>

	<p>More detailed information in advanced topics:</p>

	<details>
		<summary>On checksums and signatures:</summary>

		<p>
			Checksums are provided as <a href="https://blake3.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BLAKE3</a>
			and as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SHA512</a>.
			SHA512 sums may be deprecated in the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			Signatures use the <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Minisign</a>
			format. There are many compatible implementations of Minisign; some are listed at the above
			link. At the moment, signatures are generated using the
			<a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/rsign2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rsign2</a> tool.
		</p>

		<p>
			Releases are signed multiple times (at least once), with different keys, which provide
			different trust levels. Each project has its own <em>"automated release key"</em>, which it
			uses to sign releases when they are built, in the build infrastructure. Then, maintainers
			<em>manually</em> sign the release. The automated signature provides weak trust,
			authenticating only that a build is official. Maintainer signature(s) provide stronger trust,
			in that the release is verified by a person.
		</p>
	</details>

	<details>
		<summary>For packagers:</summary>

		<p>
			Each release on this website has a <code>meta.json</code>, see the “json metadata” link
			at the bottom of a release page. This contains all download links, sizes, checksums,
			signatures, release notes, OS information, and so on. The file is static so no rate
			limiting applies, as opposed to the GitHub API, and can be used for packaging or
			whatever other purpose. Note that the downloads themselves are hosted on GitHub, and may
			be subject to their own rate limiting.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is also a <code>latest.json</code> symlink to the meta file in each app’s release
			index, e.g. <a href="/downloads/watchexec/latest.json">/downloads/watchexec/latest.json</a>,
			pointing to the latest release’s <code>meta.json</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Using the meta files or doing your own parsing of GitHub releases is preferred over
			hardcoding the tag or filename patterns, as these may change without notice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Packagers are strongly encouraged to verify checksums and signatures as part of their
			process, where available.
		</p>
